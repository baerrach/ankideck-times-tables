# File Format #

The file is in the same format that Anki exports the file into. See [Exporting - Anki Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/exporting.html) for more details.

The file does not contain a header row.

The implicit header is:

| Note ID | Multiplier | Multiplicand | Product |

The Note ID is autogenerated by the Anki Add-on. This allows re-importing the file after making changes without creating duplicate notes.

# Importing #

Make sure the option "Update existing notes when first field matches" is chosen, or else duplicate notes will be created instead.

# Creating Notes #

The `Times Tables.csv` is a tab separated file containing the data for each note, with the values of the headers (as described above).

New values should be added to this spreadsheet with a blank Note ID.

The two plugins from [requirements](./Requirements):
* 1672832404 - [Add note id](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672832404)
* 46741504 - [Allows empty first field (during adding and import)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/46741504)
will ensure that the existing notes will get updated instead of creating duplicates.

After the new notes have been imported, you must export them back into the `.csv.` file so the new `Note ID` values are included.
